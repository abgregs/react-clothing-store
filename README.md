# React Clothing Store

This is an eCommerce store built with React using Redux and Hooks as well as Firebase for user authentication and Stripe for payments.

The project involved building a production-ready eCommerce app using important React concepts and design patterns like those listed below.

* React Hooks such as `useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext` and `useReducer`
* Dispatching actions and extracting data from the Redux store state
* Redux Thunk and Redux Saga middleware for managing Redux side effects and async actions
* Composing utilities that extend Firebase methods for user auth and database operations
* Approaches to styling components with SASS, CSS in JS, and Tailwind CSS
* Observer model and subscription mechanisms for sequences of async events
* Advanced TypeScript including typing out Firebase and Redux Saga
* Serverless functions
* Deploying with Netlify
